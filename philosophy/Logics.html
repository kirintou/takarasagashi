        <h3>Logic is the part of Philosophy that studies the nature of Logic.
            What is Logic?
            
                Deductive Logic
                Inductive Logic
            
            Deductive Reasoning (Logic)
            
            Mathematical Logic and Philosophical Logic are associated with Deductive Reasoning.
            
            Deductive Logic uses "True" and "False" as tools for Reasoning:
            
            All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore: Socrates is mortal.
            
            When it rains, things outside get wet. The grass is outside. Therefore: when it rains, the grass gets wet.
            
            It can also go wrong:
            
            Stones cannot fly. Mother cannot fly. Therefore: Mother is a stone.
            Inductive Reasoning (Logic)
            
            Philosophical Logic are also associated with Inductive Reasoning.
            
            Inductive Logic uses "Strong" and "Weak" as tools for Reasoning.</h3>
